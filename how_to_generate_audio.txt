Do this in two steps. First generate the RAW file (in audacity, there is an option to export to headerless RAW audio file under Export -> Export Audio). Make sure you export to 8-bit signed or unsigned values.

Then, using a linux tool called xxd, you convert the binary file into a c header file(I suppose you could do this with any hex viewer but I haven't tried). The header file has comma separated hexadecimal values of all samples of the audio in an array. You can copy from the array, and using a little scripting, convert those hexadecimal values into any representation.

Here is the format that xxd -i input.raw outputs by default:

unsigned char hel_raw[] = {
  0x7e, 0x7e, ......
};
unsigned int hel_raw_len = 2555;
